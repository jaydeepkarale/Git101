# The main or master is nothing special. It is just another branch and used by convention as a special branch.
In theory one can easily create a different branch as a main/master

# The output of the `git branch` command shows the current branches available and the active branch is marked with a *. How does git know which is the current
active branch ? Simple, it store the information of the current active branch in the HEAD file under the .git sub-directory.

# Fast-forward message while merging means git realized that there is an option to save creation of additonal objects
& it changed the branch into which changes are being merged to point to the commit which already exists & contains the changes.

# Detached Head occurs when you decide to checkout a commit instead of a branch. These commits remain in the system for a while but are garbage collected by GIT 
after sometime(this happens to all objects which cannot be reached via a branch). To save these commits you can create a branch on them otherwise they will be lost
eventually.
